// In React Native if we are using an Image as URL then have to put Height and width 
//  Like this :-
 <Image source={{
        width:200,
        height:300,
        uri:"https://source.unsplash.com/random",
      }} />
// In React Native i if we are using an Image as Local then don't have to put Height and width because i take its resolution from Image 
//  Like this :-
   <Image source={require("./assets/image1.jpg")}/> */}
